Routine Description:

  Starts a target block update. This records information about the write
  in fault tolerant storage and will complete the write in a recoverable
  manner, ensuring at all times that either the original contents or
  the modified contents are available.

Arguments:

  This             - Calling context
  BaseAddress      - The Firmware Volume BaseAddress of the target block.
  Lba              - The logical block address of the target block.
  Offset           - The offset within the target block to place the data.
  Length           - The number of bytes to write to the target block.
  Buffer           - The data to write.

Returns:

  EFI_SUCCESS          - The function completed successfully
  EFI_ABORTED          - The function could not complete successfully.
  EFI_BAD_BUFFER_SIZE  - The write would span a block boundary,
                         which is not a valid action.
  EFI_ACCESS_DENIED    - No writes have been allocated.
  EFI_NOT_READY        - The last write has not been completed.
                         Restart () must be called to complete it.
