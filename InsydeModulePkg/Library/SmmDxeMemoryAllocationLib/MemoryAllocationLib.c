/** @file
  Support routines for memory allocation routines based on boot services for
  Dxe phase drivers or SMM Services Table services for SMM phase drivers.

  The PI System Management Mode Core Interface Specification only allows the use
  of EfiRuntimeServicesCode and EfiRuntimeServicesData memory types for memory
  allocations through the SMM Services Table.  The functions in the Memory
  Allocation Library use EfiBootServicesData as the default memory allocation
  type.  For this SMM specific instance of the Memory Allocation Library,
  EfiRuntimeServicesData is used as the default memory type for all allocations.
  In addition, allocation for the Reserved memory types are not supported and
  will always return NULL.
