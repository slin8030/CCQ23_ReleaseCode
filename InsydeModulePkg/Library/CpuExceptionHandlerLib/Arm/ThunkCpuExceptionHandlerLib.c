/**
  Registers a function to be called from the processor interrupt handler.

  This function registers and enables the handler specified by InterruptHandler for a processor 
  interrupt or exception type specified by InterruptType. If InterruptHandler is NULL, then the 
  handler for the processor interrupt or exception type specified by InterruptType is uninstalled. 
  The installed handler is called once for each processor interrupt or exception.
  NOTE: This function should be invoked after InitializeCpuExceptionHandlers() or
  InitializeCpuInterruptHandlers() invoked, otherwise EFI_UNSUPPORTED returned.

  @param[in]  InterruptType     Defines which interrupt or exception to hook.
  @param[in]  InterruptHandler  A pointer to a function of type EFI_CPU_INTERRUPT_HANDLER that is called
                                when a processor interrupt occurs. If this parameter is NULL, then the handler
                                will be uninstalled.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The handler for the processor interrupt was successfully installed or uninstalled.
  @retval EFI_ALREADY_STARTED   InterruptHandler is not NULL, and a handler for InterruptType was
                                previously installed.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER InterruptHandler is NULL, and a handler for InterruptType was not
                                previously installed.
  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED       The interrupt specified by InterruptType is not supported,
                                or this function is not supported.
