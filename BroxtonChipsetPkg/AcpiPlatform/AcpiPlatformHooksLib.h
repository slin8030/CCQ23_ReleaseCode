Module Name:

  AcpiPlatformHooksLib.h
  
Abstract:

  This is an implementation of the ACPI platform driver.  Requirements for 
  this driver are defined in the Tiano ACPI External Product Specification,
  revision 0.3.6.

Routine Description:

  Returns the ACPI table version that the platform wants.

Arguments:

  None

Returns:

  EFI_ACPI_TABLE_VERSION_NONE if ACPI is to be disabled
  EFI_ACPI_TABLE_VERSION_1_0B if 1.0b
  EFI_ACPI_TABLE_VERSION_2_00 if 2.00

AcpiPlatformHooksGetOemFields (

  OUT UINT64  *OemTableId,
  OUT UINT32  *OemRevision
  );

/*++

Routine Description:

  Returns the OEMID, OEM Table ID, OEM Revision.

Arguments:

  None

Returns:
  OemId      - OEM ID string for ACPI tables, maximum 6 ASCII characters.
               This is an OEM-supplied string that identifies the OEM.
  OemTableId - An OEM-supplied string that the OEM uses to identify 
               the particular data table. This field is particularly useful 
               when defining a definition block to distinguish definition block 
               functions. The OEM assigns each dissimilar table a new OEM Table ID.
  OemRevision - An OEM-supplied revision number for ACPI tables. 
                Larger numbers are assumed to be newer revisions.

EFI_STATUS
AcpiPlatformHooksIsActiveTable (
  IN OUT EFI_ACPI_COMMON_HEADER     *Table
  );

/*++

Routine Description:

  Called for every ACPI table found in the BIOS flash.
  Returns whether a table is active or not. Inactive tables
  are not published in the ACPI table list. This hook can be
  used to implement optional SSDT tables or enabling/disabling
  specific functionality (e.g. SPCR table) based on a setup
  switch or platform preference. In case of optional SSDT tables,
  the platform flash will include all the SSDT tables but will
  return EFI_SUCCESS only for those tables that need to be
  published.
  This hook can also be used to update the table data. The header
  is updated by the common code. For example, if a platform wants
  to use an SSDT table to export some platform settings to the
  ACPI code, it needs to update the data inside that SSDT based
  on platform preferences in this hook.

Arguments:

  None

Returns:

  Status  - EFI_SUCCESS if the table is active
  Status  - EFI_UNSUPPORTED if the table is not active
