  Routine Description:
    The entry point for an Socket Service Driver simply allocates space for
    an  EFI_DRIVER_BINDING_PROTOCOL protocol instance, initializes its contents,
    and attaches this protocol instance to the image handle of the Socket
    Service Driver.

  Arguments:
    ImageHandle   EFI_HANDLE: The firmware allocated handle for the EFI
                  Socket Service Driver image.
    SystemTable   EFI_SYSTEM_TABLE: A pointer to the EFI system table

  Returns:
    EFI_SUCCESS:            The ISA bus driver was initialized.
    EFI_ALREADY_STARTED:    The driver has already been initialized.
    EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER:  One of the parameters has an invalid value.
    EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES:   The request could not be completed due to a lack of
                            resources.
