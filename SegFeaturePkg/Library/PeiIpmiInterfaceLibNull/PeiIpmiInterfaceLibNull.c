 Send request, include Network Function, LUN, and command of IPMI, with/without
 additional data to BMC.

 @param[in]        NetFn                Network Function of the IPMI command want to send.
 @param[in]        Cmd                  Command code of the IPMI command want to send.
 @param[in]        SendData             Optional arguments, if an IPMI command is required to
                                        send with data, this argument is a pointer to the data buffer.
                                        If no data is required, set this argument as NULL.
 @param[in]        SendLength           When sending command with data, this argument is the length of the data,
                                        otherwise set this argument as 0.
 @param[out]       RecvData             Data buffer to put the data read from BMC.
 @param[in out]    RecvLength           in : Length of RecvData
                                        out : Length of Data readed from BMC.


 @retval EFI_SUCCESS                    Execute command successfully.
 @retval EFI_NO_MAPPING                 The request Network Function and the response Network Function
                                        does not match.

                                        the error processing make BMC to enter "Idle State" successfully.

                                        the error processing make BMC to enter "Idle State" successfully.
                                        For SMIC system interface: Unspecified error or abort.
                                        For BT system interface: It won't have this error.
 @retval EFI_TIMEOUT                    For KCS system interface:

                                        For BT system interface:
                                        1. B_BUSY and H2B_ATN bit are not cleared in a given time.

 @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR               For KCS system interface:
                                        1. When writing to BMC, BMC cannot enter "Write State",
                                        the error processing cannot make BMC to enter "Idle State".
